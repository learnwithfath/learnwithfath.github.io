Let's dive into your first interactive lesson!

### Understanding Code Blocks
Throughout this platform, you'll see code blocks like this:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Learner");
```

You can copy these code blocks and try them in your own environment.

### Try It Yourself
Here's a simple exercise:

1. Open your code editor
2. Create a new file called `hello.js`
3. Copy the code above
4. Run it using Node.js: `node hello.js`

Positive
: Great job! You've run your first code snippet!

### Understanding Info Boxes
You'll see different types of info boxes:

### Time Estimates
Each section shows an estimated duration. This helps you:
* Plan your learning sessions
* Track how much time you need
* See your remaining time

### Bookmarking
The platform remembers where you left off, so you can:
* Close your browser and come back later
* Continue from where you stopped
